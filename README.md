# Snakes-Game
### This is a snake game written in Python using the PyGame library. I have learnt to make games of this type from youtube video series and tried to implement them myself. This is one of the basic game for anyone who is thinking to get into game development or trying to code in python. I have used PyCharm IDE for building this snake eater game.
